            "content": "Used Gaia DR3 stellar catalogues and a Milky Way–like N-body simulation to probe the Galaxy’s bar and density structure. I trained a TensorFlow model on Gaia photometry to automatically identify red clump giants (standard-candle tracers), then applied the classifier to hundreds of millions of stars and to the simulation to locate bar-induced dark gaps and compare observed and simulated density patterns."
