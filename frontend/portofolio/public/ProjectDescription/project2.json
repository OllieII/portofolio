            "content": "This project builds interpretable early-quit detectors from VR head-movement telemetry. We extract quaternion-based head rotations (and positions when available) from gameplay logs, convert them to per-frame Euler deltas, and segment the stream into direction-consistent intervals in yaw, pitch, and roll. These interval durations and movement magnitudes are then binned on power-of-two time scales to produce length-invariant histograms of “how often” and “how long” different kinds of head turns occur. Using these features, we construct balanced session-level datasets in HDF5 and train group-aware classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to distinguish completing vs. quitting sessions, with t-tests, simple hand-crafted detectors, SHAP, and partial-dependence plots used to interpret which rotation patterns are most predictive."
