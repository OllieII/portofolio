These projects involve implementing classical and fundamental deep learning algorithms/architectures/strategies (including neural network forward and backward pass) from scratch.\n\nGitHub repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/OllieII/-CS639-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/tree/main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/OllieII/-CS639-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision</a>"
